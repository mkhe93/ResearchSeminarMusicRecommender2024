## üïµÔ∏è Introduction

This repository contains code and resources for the research seminar titled "Non-Deep Learning Collaborative Filtering Techniques for Implicit Feedback Data in Music Recommender Systems." The focus of this seminar is on applying user-based and item-based neighborhood techniques, as well as matrix factorization using alternating least squares (ALS) optimization, to a real-life dataset with binary feedback. By implementing and evaluating these classical collaborative filtering methods, this work aims to establish a baseline for future research in music recommender systems, facilitating the development and comparison of more advanced techniques.

## üíæ Dataset

- \# of customers: 58.747
- \# of records: 37.370


| \#    | file name | \# rows, (users, items) | sparsity | features |
| ----- | --------- | ----------------------- | -------- | ---------|
| **1** | `user_item_interaction_RAW_ANONYMIZED.txt` | 23.545.542, (70.309, 37.408) | 0.68 % | userID, itemID   |
| **2** | `user_item_interaction_FILTERED_ANONYMIZED.txt` | 17.665.904, ( 58.747, 37.370 ) | 0.8 % | userID, itemID |

## üíé Evaluation

After the hyperparameter search, the best 3 settings for each algorithm were applied to the entire filtered dataset. A Top-10 recommendation was made for a random set of 100 users. This process was repeated 5 times for each algorithm and each parameter setting, and the mean of the best 5 runs is reported in the following table in descending order by the NDCG. The best values are printed in bold and the second largest are underlined:

## Setup

### Download and store the Dataset

The dataset can be found in the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PI544RBO7bsEMeUBa-pnzRYXKXgHcfJG?usp=sharing). Store the containing files as follows:

- `user_item_interaction_RAW_ANONYMIZED.txt` -> `data/raw`
- `user_item_interaction_FILTERED_ANONYMIZED.txt` -> `data/processed`

### Setup Virtual Environment

#### Setup with Conda (recommended)

Create virtual environment with predefined libraries:

        conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt

#### Setup with Pip

0. Use python version between 3.8 and 3.9 (3.9.19 used and recommended)

1.  Create virtual environment in project directory (`ResearchSeminarMusicRecommender2024`):

        python3 -m venv .venv

2.  Activate virtual environment:

- on Mac / Linux:

        source .venv/bin/activate

- on Windows:

        .venv\Scripts\activate

3. Upgrade pip

        pip3 install --upgrade pip

4.  Install Packages

        pip install -r PIP_Requirements.txt


### Export requirements.txt

Open the terminal, activate the environment, and run: 

#### For Conda

        conda list -e > requirements.txt

#### For Pip

        pip list --format=freeze > requirements.txt
